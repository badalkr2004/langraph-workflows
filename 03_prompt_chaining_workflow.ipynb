      "    *   The original way to declare variables in JavaScript (pre-ES6).\n",
      "    *   Still valid, but largely superseded by `let` and `const`.\n",
      "*   **B. Scoping: Function-Scoped (or Global-Scoped)**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** Variables declared with `var` are accessible throughout the *entire function* they are declared in, regardless of block statements (if, for, while). If declared outside any function, they become global.\n",

      "    ```\n",
      "*   **C. Hoisting:**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** `var` declarations are \"hoisted\" to the top of their function (or global) scope. Initializations are *not* hoisted. The variable is initialized with `undefined`.\n",
      "    *   **Code Example:** Accessing `var` before declaration.\n",

      "    *   **Explanation:** Variables declared with `let` are confined to the block (any `{}` curly braces) in which they are declared. This includes `if` blocks, `for` loops, `while` loops, and function blocks.\n",

      "    ```\n",
      "*   **C. Hoisting and the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**\n",
      "    *   **Explanation:** `let` declarations are also hoisted, but they are not initialized with `undefined`. Instead, they enter a \"Temporal Dead Zone\" (TDZ) from the start of their block until their declaration is processed. Accessing a `let` variable in the TDZ results in a `ReferenceError`.\n",
      "    *   **Code Example:** Accessing `let` before declaration.\n",

      "    let z = 30;\n",

      "        *   Re-assignment of a `let` variable *is allowed*.\n",

      "    let b = 1;\n",
      "    // let b = 2; // Error: Identifier 'b' has already been declared\n",
      "    b = 3;       // Re-assignment (no error)\n",

      "    console.log(c); // Output: 1\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "*   **E. The `const` Nuance: Immutability of Reference vs. Value**\n",
      "    *   **Crucial Explanation:** `const` does *not* make the *value* immutable, only the *binding* (the reference) immutable.\n",
      "    *   **For Primitive Values:** The value itself cannot change.\n",
      "    *   **For Objects and Arrays:** The variable cannot be reassigned to a *new* object/array, but the *contents* of the object/array *can* be modified.\n",
      "    *   **Code Example:** Modifying a `const` object/array.\n",
      "    ```javascript\n",
      "    const user = { name: \"Alice\", age: 30 };\n",
      "    user.age = 31; // Allowed!\n",
      "    console.log(user); // Output: { name: \"Alice\", age: 31 }\n",

      "    // user = { name: \"Bob\" }; // Error: Assignment to constant variable.\n",
